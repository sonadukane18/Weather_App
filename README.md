# Weather_App
 A Weather App using Python. It is a completely gui tkinter project.  We will use the Open Weather Map API to get the data. 

 This is a Python program using the Tkinter library to create a weather application. The program uses the Geopy library to get the latitude and longitude of a given location and the TimezoneFinder library to get the timezone of that location. It also uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for the given location, such as the temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure and a description of the weather conditions. The program displays the current time and weather data in the GUI. The user can enter a location in the search box and press
